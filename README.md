# Fractal Explorer
This is a simple Mandelbrot Fractal Explorer written in Java.

If you don't know what the Mandelbrot Set/Fractal is, check out this article on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) or just check it out on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=mandelbrot+fractals) (They have a really cool doodle with a zooming in on the fractal).
